# Cybernerddd Multi-Tool

This is a small offensive security tool I'm building as I learn more about Python, hacking, and automation.  
Nothing crazy yet, just a clean CLI tool with subcommands I can keep upgrading over time.

Right now it has:
- Port scanning (`scan`)
- Directory bruteforce mode (`brute`)
- System command execution (`exec`)

I'm still learning and improving, so I'll keep adding features like:
- Better scan engine (with sockets + threading)
- Real directory brute-force with HTTP requests
- Colored output
- Error handling upgrades
- More pentesting utilities

This is basically my personal hacking toolkit growing piece by piece.

If you have ideas or want to contribute, feel free, I'm building this as a long-term project.
